    "# Rate my Professor Project\n",
    "This is Part 2 of a comprehensive RateMyProfessor project aimed at building an overview of faculty and professor ratings at Cal Poly Pomona. The goal is to provide students with accessible and aggregated insights into how professors are rated on the RateMyProfessor platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase of the project, we focus on basic data cleaning of the in-depth ratings, student comments, and specific course information contained within our CSV dataset. The goal is to prepare the data for more advanced analysis by ensuring consistency, accuracy, and completeness across key fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the initial cleaning is complete, we plan to transition to using SQL for deeper analysis, including joining this dataset with Part 1 of the project to enable richer, more integrated insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected using a custom web scraping bot built with Selenium, designed to extract information on both current and former professors at Cal Poly Pomona.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset below was scraped from RateMyProfessor and contains information on faculty from Cal Poly Pomona. Each row represents a professor, along with their aggregated rating and departmental data. \n",

    "# Finalization of Cleaned DataFrame\n",
    "To prepare the dataset for analysis, we performed several key final cleaning steps to ensure consistency, accuracy, and usability:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Standardization of Professor Names: We carefully standardized the formatting of professor names, ensuring uniform casing and spacing. When middle names or initials were present, we retained only the first and last names to avoid inconsistencies. Care was taken to avoid unintentionally merging or removing distinct entries that differed only by middle names or initials.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Conversion of 'Would_Take_Again' to Float: The 'Would_Take_Again' column, originally containing percentage values as strings (e.g., \"75%\") or missing entries, was cleaned by stripping the percentage sign, converting to float (e.g., 75.0), and filling missing values with 0.0 for consistency and numeric analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Duplicate Checking: We checked for and removed any exact duplicate rows that could distort the analysis. Additionally, near-duplicates based on key features (e.g., professor name and course) were reviewed and verified to ensure no data was mistakenly discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Validation of Numerical Columns: We conducted sanity checks on numeric columns like 'avg_rating', 'avg_difficulty', and 'Would_Take_Again' to ensure no out-of-range or unusual values existed. These columns were confirmed to fall within expected boundaries (e.g., ratings between 1 and 5, difficulties between 1 and 5, and percentages between 0 and 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Department Name Standardization: We standardized department names to eliminate variations due to abbreviations, typos, or inconsistent naming (e.g., \"Comp Sci\", \"Computer Science Dept\" → \"Computer Science\"). This step ensures that aggregation and grouping by department remain accurate.\n"
